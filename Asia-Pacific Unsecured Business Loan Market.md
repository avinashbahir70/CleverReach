The absence of collateral requirements makes unsecured loans an attractive solution for small and medium-sized retail businesses that may not have sufficient assets to offer as security. Additionally, unsecured business loans are helping retailers navigate cash flow challenges, particularly during seasonal spikes in demand. With the rise of e-commerce in the region, online retailers also seek unsecured loans to invest in digital infrastructure, marketing, and supply chain improvements.
